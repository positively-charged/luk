lukd file format
===========================================================================

Type definitions:
   Byte == typedef unsigned char Byte; ( 1 byte )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first four bytes of a lukd file as a whole contain the position to the 
main table, which contains all the important information about the lukd
file.

main_table_offset             4 bytes               unsigned int

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main table contains the following fields:

first_map_entry               4 bytes               unsigned int
total_map_entries             4 bytes               unsigned int
publish_date                  4 bytes               int

The @publish_date field is a 4 byte UNIX timestamp.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The map entries correspond to the maps in the game. The map entries are 
aligned in a series. All maps have a @name. The maximum length for a map
name is set by the lump limit of a wad, which is 8 characters. Any names
shorter than this limit must have their unused space filled in with NULL
characters. The starting map entry is found at the position given by the 
@first_map_entry field of the header. The total number of entries in the 
lukd file is given by @total_map_entries field of the header. Each map 
entry contains the following fields:

name                          8 bytes               Byte[ 8 ]
first_record                  4 bytes               unsigned int
total_records                 4 bytes               unsigned int

All unused space in the @name field should be filled in with NULL Bytes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each map entry can have a variable length of records, but the number
of current records for a particular entry is stored in the entry's
@total_records field. The records for each map entry are aligned
in a connected series, like that of the map entries. The position of
the starting record for a given map entry can be found by looking at
the map's @first_record field. Each record consists of the 
following fields:

Record:
   Record Header:
      key_size                4 bytes               unsigned int
      value_size              4 bytes               unsigned int

   Record Body:
      key                     key_size              Byte[ key_size ]
      value                   value_size            Byte[ value_size ]
